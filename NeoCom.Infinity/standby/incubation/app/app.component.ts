//  ENVIRONMENT: Angular 4
//  DESCRIPTION: Angular source code to run on a web server almost the same code as on the Android platform.
//               The project has 3 clear parts. One is the Java libraries that are common for all platforms,
//               the second is the java microservices that compose the web application backend made with
//               SpringBoot technology and finally the web ui code made in typescript within the Angular
//               framework.
