  title: NeoCom Infinity Backend Public API
  description: |
    # Summary

    ### This is the OpenApi specification active and matching the latest published backend application version seen on the Heroku Production servers.
    This API defines all the client REST endpoints public and available to other systems. The API definition follows the OpenApi 3.0 specification
    and there are provisioning for automatic code generation for this API clients.

    This specification describes the implemented API for the backend on the application **NeoCom.Infinity**. The end points
    described are expected to be used from the **Angular Frontend** application. The ouputs are formatted as JSON results and will
    be consumed by json compliant applications or by clients that will transform them to Java instances. The recommended json deserializer is GSON.

    For java transformation the JSON code could be used to generate the transformation code at the next link. **http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/**.

    # System Description

    The backend is a single standalone SpringBoot server but that publishes more than a single service. There are 3 main services at this version:

    * **neocom** - this is the authenticated set of endpoints that will collect and the data that can only be obtained when a Pilot is
    authenticated on the ESI services page. Some of the endpoints may also have a counterpart on the other services for public or data that can
    also be obtained with no authentication.
    * **public** - Endpoints that export some sets of data like Character or Market or any other section and that do no require authentication.
    * **universe** - Endpoints that reference universe or game data and not related to any of the previous or so generic and core that can be used
    from anywhere. There are endpoitns for locations, types and other game data structures.

    * **spacelocations** - This service will search for detailed data about a space location identifier and get the type, system, statios or
    structure and any other specific data that is related to the location. Wormholes are still unsupported as many of the out of common space
    coordinates.
    * **items** - This is the item database access service. It will add all sorts of market data to each of the available items.

    The exported data is being improved for HATEOAS support so now some of the endpoints will replace resolved esi data by an equivalent http link.
    This will help to reduce response times because there is no need to go to the ESI servers to get the data (this is specially severe when there
    are collections of data). The consumer application is really required that detailed data can follow the link to retrieve the additional
    information but this is done at the user selection pace and not preloading all possible data records.


    This is most effective on long lists like assets or fittings. Now instead of resolving each of the item accesses and also getting each item
    market information the response will just report a link. Following that link we get the item and from it we can get any market additional data
    is really required.

    ## CHANGES:
    * [20201226] *Introduced the new Market Data endpoints both for authenticated and universal access.*

    ## TODO:
    * [20201019] *Replace old api endpoints by the new HAL endpoints and also document the corrent exception responses.*
    * [20191025] *Complete the definition for the NeoComExceptionResponse once I have the correct serialization data.*
