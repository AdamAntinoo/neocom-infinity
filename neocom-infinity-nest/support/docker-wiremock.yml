# FRONTEND - Docker Composer components
# PROJECT CODE - 52
#
# Docker composer automatically creates a network. The container host matches the container name. To differentiate and create single networks use a directory name that should be unique. The recommended format is: <project>-docker-<environment>
#
# The routing references are:
# /characters - calls to the ESI data provider service for character secured data.
