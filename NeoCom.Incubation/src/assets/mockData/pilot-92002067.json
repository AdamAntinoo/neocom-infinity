    "description": "Once a thriving tribal civilization, the Minmatar were enslaved by the Amarr Empire for more than 700 years until a massive rebellion freed most, but not all, of those held in servitude. The Minmatar people today are resilient, ingenious, and hard-working. Many of them believe that democracy, though it has served them well for a long time, can never restore what was taken from them so long ago. For this reason they have formed a government truly reflective of their tribal roots. They will forever resent the Amarrians, and yearn for the days before the Empire's accursed ships ever reached their home skies.",
