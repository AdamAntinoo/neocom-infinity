Amarr citizens tend to be highly educated and fervent individuals, and as a culture Amarr adheres to the basic tenet that what others call slavery is in fact one step on a indentured person's spiritual path toward fully embracing their faith. Despite several setbacks in recent history, the Empire remains arguably the most stable and militarily powerful nation-state in New Eden.",
