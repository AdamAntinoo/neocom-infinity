  "description": "Massive Scordite was the stuff of legend in the early days of space exploration, due to a 10% higher mineral yield than standard scordite. Though it has long since been taken over in value by other ores it still has a special place in the hearts of veteran miners.\r\n\r\nScordite is amongst the most common ore types in the central regions of known universe. It has a fair bit of <a href=showinfo:34>Tritanium</a> and <a href=showinfo:35>Pyerite</a>.
