EveContent - has all global structures like database, mapper and sde
Accesible at te CharacterUseCase that receives the messages to
store or retrieve the data for example when openning an Activity hrough
a backtask
Use case has also the access to the EveJobs

EveContent - has also the method to read the model data from the storage system
so this is the place we obtain the ESIPlanetary. This data is the data
stred at the database.

Stream - sequence of filters that will call the ViewMapper to convert some
intances to others.

ViewMapper - Using the mapper thansforms the code from the source ESI class
to any desired destination class. Is like my manual constructions of
wrappers. This view mapper changes the instances to the View classes that
in reality are models. Then the injectos to the view should transform
that into Views.

RecyclerView - instead of having views on the adapter it has the View
class instances that get converted to ViewHolder that is the equivalence
for the View on the other ListViews.


Then this data et into the Adapter that reinstalls the views and
does the notificationn.
