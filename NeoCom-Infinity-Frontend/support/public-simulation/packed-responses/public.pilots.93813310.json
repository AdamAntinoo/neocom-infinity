        "description": "Once a thriving tribal civilization, the Minmatar were enslaved by the Amarr Empire for more than 700 years until a massive rebellion freed most, but not all, of those held in servitude. The Minmatar people today are resilient, ingenious, and hard-working. Many of them believe that democracy, though it has served them well for a long time, can never restore what was taken from them so long ago. For this reason they have formed a government truly reflective of their tribal roots. They will forever resent the Amarrians, and yearn for the days before the Empire's accursed ships ever reached their home skies.",

Despite presenting a tough, no-nonsense exterior, they are deeply introspective, aware of even the smallest detail at all times. Immersed in ancient martial traditions that begin at childhood, they are physically robust individuals and intimidating to face in the flesh.",
