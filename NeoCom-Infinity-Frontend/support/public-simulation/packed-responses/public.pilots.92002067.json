The Minmatar people today are resilient, ingenious, and hard-working. Many of them believe that democracy, though it has served them well for a long time, can never restore what was taken from them so long ago. For this reason they have formed a government truly reflective of their tribal roots. They will forever resent the Amarrians, and yearn for the days before the Empire's accursed ships ever reached their home skies.",
